                                Marked by consoles like the Magnavox Odyssey and Atari Pong, AI was rudimentary. 
                                "Enemies" were controlled by simple, predefined algorithms, based on fixed rules and direct reactions to player movements. 
                                Pong’s AI only moved the opponent’s paddle to intercept the ball, with no learning capability.

                                With the Atari 2600, AI began to show more elaborate movement patterns. 
                                Games like Pac-Man used Finite State Machines (FSMs) to control ghosts, each with a distinct chase and scatter pattern. 
                                Although still predictable, these behaviors added personality to NPCs.

                                The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) brought NPCs that seemed smarter, even though still rule-based. 
                                AI created enemies with patrol routes, coordinated attacks, and reactions to specific events. 
                                RPGs began using AI to control monster and boss behavior.

                                With the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis, processing power allowed for more sophisticated AIs. 
                                Enemies could have multiple states and smoother transitions, reacting more convincingly to the player. 
                                Fighting games featured opponents with different combat styles and move sequences.

                                The arrival of PlayStation and Nintendo 64 marked the transition to 3D graphics, and AI also sought greater realism. 
                                NPCs began to have more complex behaviors in three-dimensional environments, such as maze navigation and use of cover. 
                                FPS games benefited from AIs that could flank the player.

                                With PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube, AI became more behavioral. NPCs could have simulated emotions, react to damage more realistically, and interact with each other. 
                                Stealth games used AIs with different levels of perception (vision, hearing), requiring more elaborate strategies.

                                This generation saw AI become more predictive. Enemies could anticipate player movements, adapt their strategies in real time, and learn from past mistakes. 
                                AI in sports games became much more challenging, with opponents adjusting to player tactics.
